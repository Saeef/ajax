# Ajax  ...in progress

#### because I realized that I don't have any notes in Ajax.


-  `XMLHttpRequest` object very simple break down (see aboutAjax.md)
-  JS and jQuery methods and a few examples
-  whatever else I find relevant...it will go here

```

-   I'm also using XAMPP (OSX).  
-   If problems starting server, check ports - I had to changed   
    my default port config(3306).    
-   Served at localhost and htdocs its your root folder.    

	
```
