# Ajax  ...in progress

#### because I realized that I don't have any notes in Ajax.


-  `XMLHttpRequest` object very simple break down (see aboutAjax.md)
-  JS and jQuery methods and a few examples
-  About client.html file
-	An example of `data-binding` without angular
-	`onkeyup` a value entered into input field, is captured by $_GET, and converted   
	 to uppercase inside of server.php   
-        a new XMLHttpRequest object inside of a function in client.html, then processes this         
         the data, connects to server.php and serves it to the client browser asynchronously.	 
-  whatever else I find relevant...it will go here

```
Installation:

-   I'm also using XAMPP (OSX).  
-   If problems starting server, check ports - I had to changed   
    my default port config(3306).    
-   Served at localhost and htdocs its your root folder.
