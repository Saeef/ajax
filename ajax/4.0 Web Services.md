## Web Services
In its simplest form, a web service is a framework for a conversation between two computers over the web: a client and a server and nearly always handled over HTTP.   
You can only use web services if you know how to speak their language. There's a big difference between knowing how to talk to
a web service, and knowing and how it's working in the server environment.

When you send a request to the web service you'll need to know whether to use SOAP or JSON. HTTP PUT or GET request and so on. But,
you usually don't need to know what programming language, database or other technologies are being used in the server environment.
It doesn't matter whether the service is managed by PHP, ASP.net or Node.js. As long as you send the request in the right format
and get back the expected responses, you'll be able to call the web service from your client-side application.
